it is an application in which the user can pick the category,
 level of difficulty, the type of questions and the amount as well.
 When the user picks his prefered choices, the questions pop up as multiple questions or True/False questions depending on his preference.
 From the API we can find out wether the reponses are correct or not and the player's score will adjust.
 When the player finishes all the questions, the score will be displayed on the screen and a button to restart the game will also be available.
